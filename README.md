# heart-disease-prediction
The goal of our heart disease prediction project is to determine if a patient should be diagnosed with heart disease or not, which is a binary outcome, so: Positive result = 1, the patient will be diagnosed with heart disease. Negative result = 0, the patient will not be diagnosed with heart disease.
